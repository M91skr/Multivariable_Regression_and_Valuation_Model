# Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model


## Description
In this code, a dataset ofWe have data from Boston, Massachusetts in the 1970s. Boston, Massachusetts in the 1970s.

We are going to build a model that can provide a price estimate based on house features such as:
    • number of rooms
    • Distance to employment centers
    • How rich or poor is the area?
    • How many students per teacher are there in local schools, etc

In summary, they were done:
    • Analyzing home price data in Boston
    • Split data for training and testing
    • Running a multivariate regression
    • Evaluation of model coefficients and residuals
    • Use data transformation to improve model performance
    • Using the model to estimate property prices
